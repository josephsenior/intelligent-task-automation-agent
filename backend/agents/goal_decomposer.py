Your job is to analyze a goal and decompose it into a series of concrete, executable tasks. Each task should:
1. Be specific and actionable
2. Have clear dependencies (what must be done first)
3. Have an appropriate priority level
4. Specify what tool or action is needed

Goal to decompose: {goal_description}{context_str}

Analyze this goal and break it down into tasks. Consider:
- What are the logical steps to achieve this goal?
- What dependencies exist between tasks?
- Which tasks can be done in parallel?
- What tools or operations are needed for each task?

Return your response as a JSON object with this structure:
{{
    "tasks": [
        {{
            "description": "Clear description of what needs to be done",
            "priority": "low|medium|high|critical",

            "tool_params": {{"key": "value"}}
        }}
    ],
    "reasoning": "Brief explanation of the decomposition strategy"
}}

Make sure each task is specific enough to be executed independently. Think about the order of operations and dependencies carefully."""

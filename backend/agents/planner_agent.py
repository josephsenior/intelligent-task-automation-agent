Your job is to analyze a set of tasks and create an efficient execution plan that:
1. Respects task dependencies
2. Identifies opportunities for parallel execution
3. Orders tasks by priority
4. Optimizes for efficiency and resource usage

Goal: {goal.description}

Tasks to plan:
{json.dumps(tasks_json, indent=2)}{patterns_str}

Analyze these tasks and create an execution plan. Consider:
- What are the dependencies between tasks?
- Which tasks can be executed in parallel?
- What is the optimal order considering priorities and dependencies?
- Are there any learned patterns that suggest better approaches?
